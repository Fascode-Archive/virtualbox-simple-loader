| 1: About                           |
| Since starting a VirtualBox GUI is |
| cumbersome, I created a script     |
| that can be easily executed.       |
|                                    |
| 2: How to use                      |
| Open settings.bat                  |
| and edit the values while viewing  |
| the comments in it.                |
| Then just run the script           |
| for the action you want to run.    |
|                                    |
| 3: Uninstall                       |
| Please delete the script file.     |
| I do not use any registry or files.|
|                                    |
| 4: Attention                       |
| The patch file and settings.bat    |
| must be in the same directory.     |
|                                    |
| 5: Finallly                        |
| I'm glad to follow my Twitter.     |
